## Abstract
The biggest difference between a mid-level engineer and a senior engineer is the scale and scope of the work they're responsible for. How do you dive into complex tasks, report progress to project leadership, and stay focused with so many unknowns?

These are the questions I've continued to ask myself as I grow in my career. In this session, we'll explore the tools myself and other senior-level individual contributors use to shape our work from project inception to delivery.
